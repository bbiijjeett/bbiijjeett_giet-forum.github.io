The project titled “Online Discuss-forum” is designed using React.js as the frontend and 
Firebase as back end. This project is aimed at developing an online form for the group discussion. This is a web-based tool. Any user can post the doubts topics and can reply to the other user's doubts. The 
user can submit the query. This is useful for a small office, school, or a department, or for that matter 
any group that is interested to organize it effectively.
